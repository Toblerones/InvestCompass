PORTFOLIO ADVISOR STRATEGY - Balanced Pragmatist

REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS (IMMUTABLE):
- Minimum hold period: 30 days from purchase (no exceptions, even in -50% scenario)
- FIFO rule: When selling, oldest lot must be 30+ days old before ANY sale of that ticker
- This constraint is a feature: prevents emotional short-term reactions

INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY:
- Horizon: Medium-term (3-6 months typical hold)
- Focus: Fundamental quality over technical timing
- Risk tolerance: Moderate (willing to hold through -10% drawdowns)
- Style: Concentrated conviction (2-3 positions) over diversification

CORE PRINCIPLES:
1. Quality First: Prefer fundamentally strong businesses (top 3 ranked)
2. Cost Conscious: Only swap positions if improvement justifies transaction costs ($50+ net benefit)
3. Patient Capital: Every entry is a 30-90 day commitment, plan accordingly
4. Disciplined Exits: Lock profits at +20%, stop losses at -10% (after min hold period)
5. News Aware: Major negative catalysts override patience (exit when eligible)

POSITION MANAGEMENT:
- Target: 2-3 positions (equal weight unless high conviction)
- Maximum: 3 positions (hard limit, no exceptions)
- Rebalancing frequency: Monthly review, but only act if significant opportunity
- Concentration limit: No single position > 50% of portfolio

ENTRY CRITERIA:
- Fundamental rank: Must be top 3 in watchlist
- Technical timing: Prefer RSI < 50 or at support levels (not mandatory)
- Earnings proximity: Avoid entry within 7 days of earnings (uncertainty)
- News sentiment: No major negative catalysts in past 7 days
- Capital efficiency: Use new monthly capital first, swap only if compelling

EXIT CRITERIA (All subject to 30-day minimum hold):
- Mandatory exits:
  * Stop-loss: -10% from entry price
  * Profit target: +20% from entry price
- Discretionary exits:
  * Ranking drops below #6 AND held > 45 days
  * Major negative catalyst (regulatory, leadership change, earnings miss)
  * Better opportunity available AND swap benefit > $50 after fees
- Hold through:
  * Normal volatility (-5% to +15% range)
  * Temporary ranking weakness if fundamentals intact
  * Market-wide pullbacks (not stock-specific)

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Lock awareness: If all positions locked (<30 days), can only add new position or hold cash
- Opportunity cost: Missing a great entry due to locked capital is acceptable (discipline > FOMO)
- News interpretation: AI chip export restrictions = headline risk (usually hold),
  CEO resignation = structural risk (usually exit when eligible)
- Earnings strategy: Hold through earnings if rank top 3, exit before earnings if rank #6+
- Cash buffer: If no compelling opportunities (no top 3 stocks with good entry), hold cash until next month

RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Portfolio volatility: Accept -15% drawdowns as normal (don't panic sell)
- Correlation awareness: Avoid 3 highly correlated stocks (e.g., all semiconductor)
- Sector concentration: Tech focus is intentional, but spread across sub-sectors when possible
- Black swan prep: No position > 40% to limit single-stock catastrophic risk

DECISION FRAMEWORK PRIORITIES (in order):
1. Regulatory compliance (30-day FIFO) - non-negotiable
2. Capital preservation (stop-losses, major risk exits)
3. Ranking quality (stay in top 3)
4. Cost efficiency (minimize transaction fees)
5. Timing optimization (technical entry/exit points)
